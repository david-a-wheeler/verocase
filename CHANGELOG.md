and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidance for contributors.
- Pyright type checking integrated into CI (Python 3.13, standard mode);
  zero type errors at release.
- `make verify` target runs linting, type checking, and tests together.
  (`make check` is renamed to `make verify`.)
- Dependabot configured for weekly updates to GitHub Actions and pip
  dependencies.
- Pinned ruff and pyright versions in CI with pip caching, so CI runs are
  faster and more reproducible.

### Changed

- Three `Case` methods promoted from private to public API:
  `make_ltac_temp`, `check_no_existing_case_files`, and `write_start_stubs`.
- `run_selftests()` return type corrected to `bool` (was `None`); this was
  a minor latent bug surfaced by type checking.
- CI updated to use `actions/checkout` v6.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- CAE (Claims, Arguments, Evidence) diagram notation via the `cae/mermaid`
  selector; renders the argument structure in CAE style with abstract nodes
  styled distinctly.
- LTAC files now support comment lines starting with `#`; blank lines may
  appear freely (they are considered to be within a comment group).
- `bottom_padding` configuration key is now fully supported: adds an invisible
  padding node in Mermaid diagrams so GitHub's floating controls do not
  obscure the bottom row.
- `case.toml` is now accepted as an alternative config file name alongside
  `verocase.toml`.
- `--start` now includes some sample element text in the generated stub,
  making it easier to understand the format immediately.

### Changed

- Lots of internal reorganization to more clearly separate the
  "process LTAC" modes/operations from the "process document files"
  operations. This led to a number of under-the-hood API changes that I
  believe greatly simplify and clean it up.
- Reporting options (`--empty`, `--misplaced`, `--leaves`, `--packages`) may
  now be freely combined with any main mode (e.g. `--fixmissing --empty`).
  They are no longer restricted to read-only use; add `--read-only` explicitly
  if you want to suppress the default document-update pass.
- `--select`, `--info`, and `--descendants` now read from the LTAC and config
  only (never open document files) and may be combined with any main mode.
  They are mutually exclusive with each other but no longer mutually exclusive
  with modes like `--fixmissing`.

### Removed

- `--missing` and `--orphans` flags removed.  Orphan regions (document
  selectors whose ID is no longer in the LTAC) are now reported as errors
  automatically during document processing.  To check for undocumented
  elements without modifying files, use `--read-only --empty`.
- asCited option in LTAC (we handle citations differently, this was
  confusing and unnecessary).

### Fixed

- Generated element and package regions no longer have a spurious blank line
  between the "DO NOT EDIT" warning comment and the heading.
- Several GSN diagram layout fixes: bottom-padding connector length, Dagre
  cycle avoidance in LR subgraphs, and Strategy same-level placement.
- Several CAE diagram fixes: edge direction (was upside-down), BottomPadding
  placement, abstract-node CSS class application.
- Improved `&` escaping in HTML output and tightened URL/attribute sanitisation.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- `--help-api` and `--help-api-details` options document the public Python API,
  including a tree-walk example, so you can use `verocase` as a library from
  your own scripts.
- `--help-validations` and `--help-config` options provide extended help on
  available validations and configuration keys without cluttering `--help`.
- `--read-only` flag: load and validate without rewriting any document files.
- `stop` and `epilogue` selectors: control where `--fixmissing` inserts stubs
  and where main element content ends.
- `render_ext_ref` sub-selection for `element` selector regions.
- `base_url` can now be set via a per-document
  `<!-- verocase-config base_url = VALUE -->` directive.
- Mermaid click links are now always generated; when no `base_url` is
  configured, links use `#fragment`-only anchors for same-page navigation.
- Multiple timestamped snapshots are kept under `.backups/` so you can
  recover any previous state, not just the most recent one.
- Public Python API (`__all__`, full docstrings, `Case` class with instance
  methods, `load_case()`, `find_config()`, `find_document_files()`) enabling
  programmatic use of `verocase` without shelling out.

### Changed

- `--update` is renamed to `--sync` (syncs citation statement text from their
  declarations); the old name no longer exists.
- Configuration format changed from JSON to TOML: rename `case.config` to
  `verocase.toml` and update syntax accordingly. TOML is more readable and
  avoids quoting surprises.
- `--stats` output is restructured; new fields are now shown including
  document region counts and empty-region counts.
- Mermaid node IDs are simplified and guaranteed unique, producing cleaner
  diagram source.
- GSN diagrams now use `curve:basis` for smoother connector rendering.
- `VerocaseError` is now raised (instead of `sys.exit()`) when `verocase` is
  used as a library, so callers can catch and handle errors programmatically.
- `analysis_leaves` (`--leaves`) simplified: reports all definition nodes
  that have no children, regardless of citation status.

### Fixed

- Mermaid click links now correctly point to element anchors rather than
  external references.
- `Link ^Foo` cross-package citation resolution corrected.

### Removed

- All pre-1.0 backward-compatibility aliases and shims have been dropped;
  update any direct API calls to use the current names.
  We'll be more fussy about backwards incompatibility once we hit 1.0,
  but now is the time to make big changes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-11

Initial release.

### Added

**LTAC file support**
- Parse our extended LTAC (Lightweight Text Assurance Case) format,
  supporting node types: Claim, Strategy, Evidence, Context, Assumption,
  Justification, Link, Relation, and Connector.
- Cross-package citations using `^ID` syntax.
- Node options: `needssupport`, `axiomatic`, `defeated`, `assumed`,
  `abstract`, `counter`.
- External references in parentheses, e.g. `(hazard-analysis.pdf)`.
- Identifier inference from statement text when no explicit ID is given.
- Disambiguation syntax: `()` and `{}` at the end of statement text.
- Auto-discovery of `case.ltac` (and `docs/case.ltac` as fallback); override
  with `--ltac`.

**Document processing**
- Process Markdown (`.md`) and HTML (`.html`) documentation files containing
  `<!-- verocase SELECTOR -->` ... `<!-- end verocase -->` regions.
- Default inline mode: rewrite document files in place, replacing stale region
  content with freshly generated output.
- `--stdout` filter mode: write processed output to stdout without modifying
  any files.
- `--read-only`: load and validate without rewriting document files.
- `--validate`: validate a document without producing any output.
- `--strip`: remove generated content from regions, leaving only the markers.
- Per-document `<!-- verocase-config KEY = VALUE -->` directives to override
  configuration within a document.
- Auto-discovery of `case.md` (and `docs/*.md`, `docs/*.html`); override with
  explicit file arguments.

**Selectors** (used in `<!-- verocase SELECTOR -->` regions and `--select`)
- `element ID`: generate element heading, statement, and cross-reference
  subsections.
- `package ID` / `package *`: generate a diagram for one package or all
  packages.
- `statement ID`: emit the statement text for an element.
- `sacm/mermaid`, `gsn/mermaid`: SACM or GSN diagram in Mermaid syntax.
- `sacm/mermaid/html`, `gsn/mermaid/html`: as above, with a Mermaid JS
  `<script>` tag injected once per HTML document.
- `ltac/markdown`, `ltac/html`: LTAC tree as a formatted list.
- `ltac/txt`: raw LTAC text for an element.
- `referenced_by`, `supported_by`, `supports`: cross-reference subsections.
- `pkg_defines`, `pkg_citing`, `pkg_cited`: package relationship sections.
- `representation`: default representation for a package (configurable).
- `warning`: emit a warning about elements lacking document coverage.
- `stop`: stop inserting stubs after this point (`--fixmissing`).
- `epilogue`: mark the end of main element content.
- Shorthand expansions: `sacm` → `sacm/mermaid`, `gsn` → `gsn/mermaid`,
  `ltac` → `ltac/markdown` (renderer determined by `default_renderer` and
  `default_representation` config keys).

**Diagram rendering**
- SACM diagrams rendered as Mermaid flowcharts, including inference groups
  and Strategy absorption.
- GSN diagrams rendered as Mermaid flowcharts with Connector support.
- Automatic width management for wide packages: narrows diagrams that exceed
  `max_mermaid_children` by keeping only the nearest siblings
  (`narrowed_mermaid_children`) with ellipsis nodes indicating hidden children.
- Hyperlink nodes to anchors in the document via `base_url` /
  `markdown_base_url` configuration.

**LTAC mutation operations**
- `--update`: sync citation statement text from their declarations.
- `--rename OLD NEW`: rename an identifier throughout the LTAC file and all
  document files.
- `--restate ID TEXT`: replace the statement for an identifier.
- `--detach ID`: remove a node from its parent (leaving it parentless).
- `--move ID DEST`: move a node to a new parent.
- All mutations are applied atomically with a timestamped backup snapshot
  created under `.backups/` before any files are modified.

**Document repair**
- `--fixmissing`: insert stub `element` selector regions for LTAC elements
  that have no corresponding document region, positioned near their natural
  order in the document.
- `--fixmisplaced`: reorder `element` selector regions in a document to match
  the order declared in the LTAC file.

**Analysis and reporting**
- `--stats`: print statistics about the LTAC structure (element counts by
  type, package sizes, citations) and processed documents (region counts,
  empty regions).
- `--missing`: report LTAC elements that have no `element` selector in any
  document.
- `--empty`: report `element` selector regions that contain no prose.
- `--orphans`: report stale selector regions referring to identifiers no
  longer in the LTAC file.
- `--misplaced`: report `element` selector regions that are in the wrong
  document order relative to the LTAC file.
- `--leaves`: report leaf elements (no children, not cited).
- `--packages`: report package-level information.

**Validation**
- Structural validation: warn when node types are used in invalid parent
  relationships (e.g. Claim under Evidence).
- Duplicate identifier detection.
- Circularity detection in the LTAC tree.
- Anchor uniqueness checking (no two elements produce the same HTML anchor).
- Citation consistency: cited nodes should have statements matching their
  declaration.
- Indentation error detection in LTAC files.
- Dubious reference heuristic: warn when a parenthetical looks like a prose
  comment rather than an external reference (disable with
  `warn_dubious_reference = false`).
- Element coverage: warn when a declared LTAC element has no `element`
  selector in any processed document.
- `--error` flag to escalate all warnings to errors (non-zero exit).

**Configuration**
- `--config FILE`: load configuration from a JSON file.
- Configuration keys: `base_url`, `markdown_base_url`, `bottom_padding`,
  `default_renderer`, `default_representation`, `document_files`,
  `element_level`, `element_selections`, `ltac_file`, `max_backups`,
  `max_mermaid_children`, `mermaid_js_url`, `narrowed_mermaid_children`,
  `package_level`, `package_selections`, `pkg_label`,
  `warn_dubious_reference`.

**Project bootstrapping**
- `--start`: create initial `case.ltac` and `case.md` stub files.

**Infrastructure**
- CI testing across Python 3.8 through 3.13 via GitHub Actions.
- PyPI publishing via Trusted Publisher (OIDC); no stored API tokens required.
- Reproducible builds: `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is set from the last git commit
  timestamp, producing bit-for-bit identical archives across builds.
- Distributed as a single dependency-free Python script (`verocase.py`) and
  as a PyPI package installable with `pip install verocase`.

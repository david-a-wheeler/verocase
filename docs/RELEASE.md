# Release Process

This document describes the step-by-step process for publishing a new
verocase release to PyPI.

## Prerequisites

- You must have write access to the
  [verocase GitHub repository](https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/verocase).
- The PyPI trusted publisher must already be configured (see below).
  No PyPI API token or password is needed.

---

## Step-by-step release

### 1. Update the version string

Edit `verocase.py` and update `__version__` near the top of the file:

```python
__version__ = '1.2.3'   # use the new version number
```

[flit](https://flit.pypa.io/) reads this value directly as the package
version (via `dynamic = ["version"]` in `pyproject.toml`), so this is the
single source of truth.

Verify the version is correct:

```sh
python3 verocase.py --version
```

### 2. Commit the version bump

```sh
git add verocase.py
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.3"
```

### 3. Create and push a signed tag

Tag names must be prefixed with `v`.  Use `--version` to confirm the exact
string to embed:

```sh
VERSION=$(python3 verocase.py --version)
git tag -s "v${VERSION}" -m "Release v${VERSION}"
git push origin main "v${VERSION}"
```

If you do not have a GPG signing key configured, use `-a` (annotated) instead
of `-s` (signed).

### 4. Create a GitHub Release

1. Go to **Releases** on the GitHub repository page.
2. Click **Draft a new release**.
3. Choose the tag you just pushed (`v1.2.3`).
4. Set the release title to `v1.2.3` (or a short description).
5. Write release notes (new features, fixes, breaking changes).
6. Click **Publish release**.

Publishing the release triggers the `publish.yml` workflow automatically.

### 5. Approve the publish workflow (environment gate)

The `publish.yml` workflow runs in the `pypi` GitHub Actions environment,
which should be configured to require a manual approval before deployment.

1. Go to **Actions** on the GitHub repository page.
2. Open the **Publish to PyPI** workflow run for your release.
3. Review and **Approve** the pending deployment to the `pypi` environment.

The workflow then builds the package and publishes it to PyPI without any
passwords or tokens — authentication is handled entirely by trusted publishing.

### 6. Verify the release

```sh
pip install --upgrade verocase
verocase --version
```

## Trusted publishing

We use [PyPI Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/)
(OIDC-based) rather than long-lived API tokens or passwords.

**Why this is better for security:**

- No secret credential is stored in GitHub (no `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret to
  rotate, leak, or phish).
- The PyPI token is minted on demand for a single workflow run and expires
  immediately afterward.
- The grant is scoped to one specific workflow file in one specific repository,
  so a compromised fork or unrelated workflow cannot publish.
- Eliminates the entire class of "stolen API token" supply-chain attacks.

**Configuration (already done; recorded here for reference):**

The trusted publisher was registered on PyPI with these values:

| Field       | Value            |
|-------------|------------------|
| Owner       | `david-a-wheeler` |
| Repository  | `verocase`        |
| Workflow    | `publish.yml`     |
| Environment | `pypi`            |

## Reproducible builds

Our release builds are reproducible: building from the same source tree
always produces bit-for-bit identical wheel and sdist archives.

**How:** Python's `build` module and most archive tools embed the current
wall-clock time in archive metadata by default, which causes every build to
differ. We suppress this by setting the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment
variable to the Unix timestamp of the last git commit before running
`python -m build`:

```yaml
- name: Set SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
  run: echo "SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(git log -1 --format=%ct)" >> $GITHUB_ENV

- name: Build package
  run: python -m build
```

`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is the
[reproducible-builds standard](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/)
for communicating a canonical timestamp to build tools. When set, `build`
(and the underlying flit backend) uses that timestamp for all file metadata
in the generated archives instead of the current time.

To reproduce a release locally:

```sh
export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(git log -1 --format=%ct)
python -m build
```

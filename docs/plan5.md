Mermaid doesn't handle wide constructs well. Let's discuss creating an
addition for both GSN and SACM for *rendering* (this transformation only
happens during rendering, and must not modify the original data structures).

## Stage 1: Make GSN render Connector visibly (prerequisite)

Currently `Connector` in GSN is completely transparent: `_gsn_node_decl`
returns `''` for it, and `_gsn_collect_edges` flattens its children
directly to the grandparent as if the Connector weren't there.
This is fine for LTAC-authored Connectors in GSN (GSN has no grouping
concept), but it means synthetic Connectors created for width management
(Stage 2) would do nothing in GSN — the overflow children would just
appear as additional siblings, leaving the diagram equally wide.

We fix this before implementing Stage 2.

**Changes to `_GSN_HEADER`:** add the same `classDef` used by SACM:

```
    classDef connector fill:none,stroke:#cccccc,stroke-width:1px;
```

**Changes to `_gsn_node_decl`:** return a node declaration for Connector
instead of `''` — same gray-circle shape as SACM:

```python
if node.node_type == 'Connector':
    return f'    {node.diagram_id}(("{_HAIR_SPACE}")):::connector'
```

**Changes to `_gsn_collect_edges`:** instead of flattening Connector's
children to the grandparent, emit a `parent --> connector` edge and then
recurse into the Connector's children normally (so they get
`connector --> child` edges):

```python
elif child.node_type == 'Connector':
    edge_lines.append(_edge_line(node.diagram_id, child.diagram_id,
                                 False, False, False))
    _gsn_collect_edges(child, edge_lines, leaf_nodes)
```

No existing test fixtures use Connector, so this change carries zero
fixture-update cost.  Add a test that verifies a Connector in a GSN
diagram produces a visible node declaration and edges through it (rather
than being transparent).

## Stage 2: Width-management transform

If we're rendering a diagram, we make a duplicate, and we may do some
transformations specifically for that kind of notation.
For example, in SACM, an argument that is the sole child of a Claim,
and has children, and ends up being a sibling of its former children
under a sacmDot.

For all mermaid processing,
let's look for cases there are more than `max_mermaid_children` (default 8)   
children that will be rendered from a given node
(which may be a sacmDot).
Note that we consider this *after* we move a SACM Argument to become a sibling.
Note that if in SACM there are different sacmDots, they are considered
separately (e.g., context vs. inference).
This "max children" is used for anything that has *visually* expressed
children.

In those cases, keep the first                
`narrowed_mermaid_children` (default 6), and add a Connector link in the
middle (between the kept children; if we have an odd number, prefer fewer
on the left). The Connector will have as children the remaining children,
and the algorithm recurses (we could have several layers).
E.g., with 9 children, we would have [0,1,2, Connector(6,7,8), 3,4,5]).
We do this intentionally, because mermaid naively renders left-to-right;
if we put them on the edge, mermaid would end up taking *more* room
on the screen (what we're trying to avoid).

If `max_mermaid_children` is 0, the algorithm immediately returns and
makes no transforms.

We presume that we have the invariant
`arrowed_mermaid_children < max_mermaid_children`.
Let's create a routine `config_invariant_checker`.
The routine will check that invariant, and panic with message if it's wrong.
We'll call the routine
after we've had the opportunity to load the configuration file
(we'll *always* call it, just in case our code is messed up).
We'll also call this routine every time caseproc-config changes a value.

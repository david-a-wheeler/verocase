# Stats and tree manipulation

Let's add some small options.

## Stats

Let's add the new configuration option `stats`, default false.
Let's add the option `--stats`, which after loading the configuration,
this will set this new configuration option `stats` to true.

If configuration option `stats` is true, then after processing, it
reports various statistics (if it read those files).
This won't display if we do no processing (e.g., --help won't show stats).

If we read the LTAC file, show various statistics:
- Number of Elements defined per type (Claim, Strategy, etc.)
- Total number of elements defined
- Total number of citations
- Number of leaf Claims (no children) that aren't citations (^)
- Package with largest number of elements (defined or cited) and how many
- For each option we support, number of elements with that marking
  (e.g., number of elements with needsSupport)

If we processed documents, show more statistics:
- Number of "caseproc package" regions (often 1; if it is 1, note `(typical)`)
- Number of "caseproc element" regions
- Number of elements with no interesting content
  (only blank lines or directives)
- Number of "caseproc-config" statements

If there are some other interesting statistics, suggest them

## Tree manipulators

It'd be nice to make it easy to manipulate the LTAC tree.
Let's add two new options:

`--prune ID`: Replace ID's definition in a tree with a citation of ID,
and create a new package after the current package with its structure.
Panic if `ID` isn't defined or its definition is a top level (package head).

That is, given:

~~~~ltac
- Claim C1: Foo
  - Claim C2: Bar
    - Claim C3: Baz
~~~~

The command `--prune C2` would produce:

~~~~ltac
- Claim C1: Foo
  - Claim ^C2: Bar

- Claim C2: Bar
  - Claim C3: Baz
~~~~

The next option we'll add is `--graft ID DESTINATION`, which is
the reverse of `--prune`. Given ID, which is defined at a top level,
it moves its definition to be under the DESTINATION id,
where ID is currently cited
(making ID no longer cited under DESTINATION).
Panic if ID isn't defined, DESTINATION isn't defined,
ID isn't top-level, or ID isn't cited under DESTINATION.

Given the produced LTAC after `--prune C2`, the option
`--graft C2 C1` would reverse it and produce our previous LTAC.

Let me clear up a misunderstanding: if ID is also cited elsewhere
in the tree, that is *not* a problem - it would still be cited.
Nothing in the extended LTAC specification requires that citations
only cite an ID that is at the *top* of a tree.
A citation can refer to *any* definition in any tree.
We do require that there be only 1 definition (1 use of ID without ^)
and that there be no cycles, but an ID inside a tree can be cited in
many other places.

The `--prune` and `--graft` options
should go into the same queue that
`--restate` and `--rename` use.
If there's more than one such use, they are applied in order.
Add this information to the "--help", and
specifically note the queue that all of these options share
and that their order matters if there's more than one of them.

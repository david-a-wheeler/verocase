# Specification for ltacproc

The script `ltacproc` is a Python3 script for processing
our extended version of Lightweight Text Assurance Case (LTAC) format
and generating useful results to enable easy documentation and revision
of assurance cases.

## Summary

The script `ltacproc` can take information in LTAC format and
generate SACM notation in mermaid diagram format.
We eventually hope to support other notations (like GSN and CAE)
and other diagram formats.
It can also generate a markdown indented bullet list that looks like LTAC
format but adds hyperlinks, as well as other useful information.

Perhaps most usefully, it can process a markdown file and replace marked
sections with updated generated information. As a result,
users can simply run the
program with a sequence of markdown filenames, and the program
will update the markdown with the latest LTAC information.

The specification of LTAC we implement is in file
[docs/ltac-extended.txt](docs/ltac-extended.txt).

When generating SACM in mermaid format it will generate files per
[docs/sacm-mermaid.md](docs/sacm-mermaid.md).

## Technical

The program is implemented in a single file to simplify deployment.

It's written in Python3 because many can easily run and edit that.
Only use dependencies built in to Python (but *do* use those as appropriate).

It should be written in good and common style (e.g., implmement
PEP 8 as appropriate). It should be
importable as a library (though we primarily intend for it to be used
as a command line script).

The code should be organized into clear reusable parts.
For example, there should be a simple routine for turning a
normal string into a GitHub id fragment.

## Usage

```
ltacproc [--sacm|-s] [--gsn|-g] [--mermaid|-m] [--markdown-output|-o]
         [--config JSON] [--help] [--validate]
         [--markdown-input|-I] [--inline|-i] [files]
```

Meaning:

* `[--sacm|-s]`: Generate
   [Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM)
   graphics notation (default)
* `[--gsn|-g]`: Generate Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) (FUTURE capability)
* `[--mermaid|-m]`: Generate graphics in mermaid format (default)
  (we hope to support other formats in the future)
* `[--markdown-output|-o]`: Generate markdown output instead of graphics.
  This looks much like LTAC format, but the bullet items have
  markdown URL links. This isn't used often, but is helpful for debugging.
* `[--config JSON]`: Configure the tool per JSON.
* `[--help]`: Print usage information.
* `[--validate]`: Report errors on stderr (as usual), but otherwise
  don't output or change files. This would report if, for example, a
  node was subordinate to the "wrong" type.
* `[--markdown-input|-I]`: Input is in markdown format.
  Read and print to standard output the markdown, but handle marked regions
  specially (see below).
* `[--inline|-i] [files]`: Input is in markdown format in the listed files.
  Each file is processed like `--markdown-input`, handling marked
  regions specially, but each of the
  markdown files are replaced with their updated forms.

By default, without `--markdown-input` or `--inline`, we'll read
LTAC format. If no files are listed (or a file is `-`) we read from stdin.
By default its results go to standard output.
By default, this is a filter.
Error reports go to stderr.

By default, its input is a set of LTAC commands.
By default, its output is mermaid displaying SACM notation with our
conventions per `docs/sacm-mermaid.md`.

It will need to read the whole set of LTAC commands
before being able to generate a
result, since it may need to reorganize some nodes.

## Marked Regions of markdown

In markdown being read in, if a code block (using ` or ~)
is marked as being `ltac` format, its contents will be read as an LTAC
argument (package). In addition, if there is an HTML comment
on a line of its own saying
<tt>&lt;--&nbsp;ltac&nbsp;--&gt;</tt>
then the lines afterwards until are an LTAC argument (package) until
a corresponding line
<tt>&lt;--&nbsp;end&nbsp;ltac&nbsp;--&gt;</tt>.

Any one LTAC argument (package)
is expected to have one topmost Element
(it should be a Claim). This block of LTAC is considered to be the
package "Package ID" where ID is the ID of the topmost Element.
The system must record a map from the "Package ID" to the
the parsed LTAC data, as it is likely to need it later.

A line with
<tt>&lt;--&nbsp;ltac-config&nbsp;--&gt;</tt>
contains lines of JSON for configuration information until its corresponding
<tt>&lt;--&nbsp;end&nbsp;ltac-config&nbsp;--&gt;</tt>.

Any line beginning with 1+ `#` followed by a space is a markdown header.
If the header begins with "Package" or an Element type (e.g., "Claim"),
it's remembered as the default "current element".

Any line of the form
<tt>&lt;--&nbsp;ltac&nbsp;INFO--&gt;</tt>
is copied back out, but the following lines are replaced with updated data
until the corresponding line
<tt>&lt;--&nbsp;end&nbsp;ltac&nbsp;--&gt;</tt>.
Exactly what is replaced depends on INFO.
INFO has a TYPE, optionally followed by a space and element identifier
(if no element identifier is given the default "current element" is used).

* `sacm/mermaid` - SACM notation in mermaid format
* `gsn/mermaid` - GSN notation in mermaid format
* `markdown` - Markdown representation of LTAC (with hyperlinks)
* `statement` - Markdown representation showing `Statement:` followed by the
  statement of the element identifier
* `references` - Markdown representation showing `References:` followed by the
  comma-separated list of packages the element identifier is contained in,
  with hyperlinks to those packages. If there are no references, show
  `References: None`.
* `info` - A `statement`, blank line, and `references`.

## Generating hyperlinks

The mermaid output, and output markdown, will generally include hyperlinks.
The mermaid output will use the config value `base_url` as its base.
The output for markdown and referencs
will use `markdown_base_url` (default empty string) as its base.
URL fragments should use the GitHub conventions.

We presume that a *package* will have the header "Package ID".
We presume that other elements will have the header "Type ID: Statement"
where ("Type" would typically be "Claim").
The markdown processor will convert that to a GitHub-format identifier;
fragments must use the same one to match.

## Package Structure

One file only; no package structure needed. The file begins with
`#!/usr/bin/env python3`.

## Notes

Internally we'll add an element type "Connector" to represent
where we may create connectors to limit the number of elements across.

## Module Organization (sections within the single file)

Below are some thoughts on how to organize it.

1. **Shebang + imports + module docstring**
2. **Node dataclass** – the AST node
3. **Utility functions** – pure functions with no side effects
4. **LTAC parser** – text → tree of Node objects
5. **SACM renderer** – Node tree → mermaid string (default)
6. **GSN renderer** – Node tree → mermaid string (--gsn)
7. **Inline processor** – markdown text → updated markdown text
8. **main()** – CLI entry point

## Data Model

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Optional

@dataclass
class Node:
    node_type: str          # Claim | Strategy | Justification | Evidence |
                            # Context | Assumption | Link | Relation | Connector
    identifier: str         # e.g. "C1"; empty string if absent
    text: str               # descriptive text (statement / reasoning)
    ext_ref: str            # text from trailing (...), empty if absent
    options: set            # members, e.g.: needsSupport axiomatic defeated
                            #          counter abstract assumed
    children: list          # list[Node]
    is_cited: bool          # True when identifier had a ^ prefix
    cited_pkg: str          # package name from ^[PkgName] prefix; empty = default
    depth: int              # 0-based indentation level (0 = root)
    parent: Optional['Node'] # back-reference; None for roots
    mermaid_id: str         # computed valid mermaid node id (set after parse)
```

## Utility Functions

```python
def to_github_fragment(text: str) -> str:
    """Convert heading text to a GitHub anchor fragment id.

    Algorithm (matches GitHub's algorithm):
    1. Lowercase the entire string.
    2. Remove every character that is not a Unicode letter, digit,
       hyphen, or space.
    3. Replace spaces with hyphens.
    4. Collapse runs of multiple hyphens into a single hyphen.
    5. Strip leading and trailing hyphens.

    Example: "Package C1: Main Claim" -> "package-c1-main-claim"
    """

def make_mermaid_id(identifier: str, counter: list) -> str:
    """Return a valid mermaid node id for the given LTAC identifier.

    Mermaid ids must match [A-Za-z0-9_]+.
    - Hyphens and dots become underscores.
    - Other non-alphanumeric characters are removed.
    - If identifier is empty, generate '_auto{N}' using counter[0]++.
    - Prefix with underscore if the first character is a digit.
    """

def escape_html(text: str) -> str:
    """Escape text for safe embedding in mermaid HTML labels.

def parse_options(raw: str) -> set:
    """Parse a {OPTIONS} suffix string into a set of option names.

    raw is the content between { and } (already stripped of braces).

    Returns a set of lowercase strings.
    """
```

## LTAC Parser

### Line format (BNF sketch)

This isn't quite correct, it's based on an old version of the spec.

```
line     ::= INDENT '-' WS nodetype WS? cited_id? id_text? options?
nodetype ::= 'Claim' | 'Strategy' | 'Justification' | 'Evidence'
           | 'Context' | 'Assumption' | 'Link' | 'Relation' | 'Connector'
cited_id ::= '^' ('[' pkgname ']' WS)? identifier
id_text  ::= identifier ':' WS text
           | ':' WS text          (text with no identifier)
           | identifier           (identifier with no text)
options  ::= WS '{' ... '}'       (at end of line, before optional ref)
ref      ::= WS '(' reftext ')'   (external reference, at very end)
```

- `INDENT` is a multiple of 2 spaces; `depth = len(INDENT) / 2`.
- Lines beginning with `#` or that are blank are ignored (comments/blanks).
- The `:` separator is the FIRST colon after the node type keyword; everything
  before it (after the keyword) is the identifier, everything after is text.
- The external reference `(ref)` appears at the end of the line, after any
  `{OPTIONS}` block (or before it – check both orders).
- The `{OPTIONS}` block is stripped from the end of the line first.
- The `(ref)` block is extracted next.

### Parser algorithm (class LTACParser)

```python
class LTACParser:
    def parse(self, lines: list[str]) -> list[Node]:
        """Parse LTAC lines into a forest (list of root Nodes).

        Returns the list of root nodes (depth == 0).
        Also populates self.registry: dict[str, Node] mapping
        each identifier to its Node (for Link resolution).
        """
```

This needs to be updated for the current extended LTAC spec.

Steps:
1. Maintain a **depth stack** of `(depth, node)` pairs; initially empty.
2. For each non-blank, non-comment line:
   a. Count leading spaces; compute `depth = spaces // 2`.
   b. Strip leading spaces and the `- ` prefix.
   c. Strip trailing `{OPTIONS}` → parse_options() → node.options.
   d. Strip trailing `(ref)` → node.ext_ref.
   e. Match the nodetype keyword.
   f. Check for `^` prefix on identifier → set `is_cited`, `cited_pkg`.
   g. Split on first `:` to get identifier and text.
   h. Create Node; compute `mermaid_id`; register in `self.registry`.
   i. Pop stack until stack top depth < current depth.
   j. If stack is non-empty, the top is the parent; add node to parent.children.
   k. If stack is empty, node is a root; append to roots list.
   l. Push `(depth, node)` onto stack.
3. For `Link` nodes: look up `self.registry[identifier]`; if found, set
   `node.link_target = referenced_node`; if not found, warn to stderr.
4. Return roots list.

### Mermaid node declaration strings

| LTAC Type            | Condition          | Mermaid declaration                              |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Claim                | normal / asserted  | `ID["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"]`                    |
| Claim                | needsSupport       | `ID["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT<br>..."]`             |

| Claim                | defeated           | `ID["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT<br>✗"]`               |
| Claim                | assumed            | `ID["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT<br>ASSUMED"]`         |
| Claim                | abstract           | `ID["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"]:::abstractClaim`    |
| Claim                | is_cited = True    | `ID[["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"]]`                  |
| Strategy             | any                | `ID[/"<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"/]`                  |
| Evidence             | any                | `ID[("<b>LABEL</b>&nbsp;↗<br>TEXT")]`           |
| Context              | any                | `ID[("<b>LABEL</b>&nbsp;↗<br>TEXT")]`           |
| Assumption           | any                | `ID["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT<br>ASSUMED"]`         |
| Justification        | any                | `ID["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"]`                    |
| Connector            | any                | `ID((" ")):::connector`                          |
| Relation             | (no mermaid node)  | (Relation is implicit; sets options on edge)     |
| Link                 | (no new node)      | (only adds edges to the link_target node)        |

LABEL = `identifier` if non-empty, else omitted (just TEXT).
If both identifier and text are non-empty: LABEL = `ID` and TEXT = text.
The full label is `<b>ID</b><br>TEXT` or just `<b>ID</b>` if text is empty.

Assertion-state suffixes are mutually exclusive (apply only one in priority
order: defeated > axiomatic > assumed > needsSupport).

### Inference Group Algorithm (SACM)

For each non-Context, non-Link, non-Relation node X (that has children):

1. Collect `inference_sources` and `context_children`:

   ```
   inference_sources = []
   context_children = []
   for child in X.effective_children():     # see Connector handling below
       if child.node_type == 'Context':
           context_children.append(child)
       elif child.node_type == 'Strategy':
           inference_sources.append(child)
           for grandchild in child.effective_children():
               if grandchild.node_type != 'Context':
                   inference_sources.append(grandchild)
               else:
                   context_children_of_strategy.append((grandchild, child))
       else:
           inference_sources.append(child)
   ```

   `effective_children()` on a node X: if X's children include Connector
   nodes, those Connectors are represented in mermaid but their children
   are treated as if they were X's children for semantic purposes.
   A Connector node itself appears in the mermaid output.

2. Build edges:
   - Context children: `ctx_id --o X_id`
   - Context children of Strategy AR: `ctx_id --o AR_id`
   - If `len(inference_sources) == 1` and no metaClaim on X:
     - Unreified: `src_id --> X_id`
   - If `len(inference_sources) >= 2` or metaClaim:
     - Create: `DotN((" ")):::sacmDot`
     - For each source: `src_id --- DotN`
     - Then: `DotN --> X_id`

3. Recurse into each child (and grandchildren via Strategy) to collect
   their edges.

### Counter flag on edges

If a relationship has `counter` in its options:
- Replace `-->` with `-->|⊖|`
- Replace `--o` with `--o|⊖|`

### Abstract relationships

If a Relation node has `abstract` in its options:
- Replace `---` with `-.-`
- Replace `-->` with `-.->`

### Relation node semantics

When a `Relation R` node appears as a child of `X`:
- R's children are the inference sources (instead of being treated
  as children of X directly).
- R's options set options on that relationship (e.g., `defeated`).
- R does **not** produce a mermaid node declaration of its own.

### Edge and node output order

1. Declare all nodes (BFS top-to-bottom order: roots first, then children).
2. Declare all sacmDot and Connector nodes (collected during edge generation).
3. Output all edges (DFS post-order: deepest leaves first, root last).
4. Add padding: `BottomPadding[ ]:::invisible ~~~ FIRST_ROOT_ID`

## GSN Renderer (--gsn mode)

GSN mappings to mermaid shapes:

| LTAC Type      | GSN Concept   | Mermaid shape                            |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Claim          | Goal          | `ID["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"]`            |
| Strategy       | Strategy      | `ID[/"<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"/]`          |
| Evidence       | Solution      | `ID(("<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"))`          |
| Context        | Context       | `ID("<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT")`            |
| Assumption     | Assumption    | `ID(["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"])`          |
| Justification  | Justification | `ID(["<b>LABEL</b><br>TEXT"])`          |

GSN edges: direct `child --> parent` (no sacmDots).
Context connects with `--o`.
Undeveloped goals (needsSupport): append `<br>◇` to label (GSN convention).
Multiple children each get their own direct arrow (no grouping into a dot).

Output header uses `flowchart BT` without sacmDot classDef.

---

## Inline Mode (--inline / -i)

### Detection

Find fenced LTAC code blocks in markdown.

For example:

```
N backticks or tildes (N >= 3) followed immediately by 'ltac'
... LTAC content lines ...
N backticks (same count, on their own line)
```

The fence marker character is backtick or tilde.

Note: We must also handle the various markers from HTML comments.

### Algorithm

```
state: reading | in_ltac_fence | after_ltac | in_mermaid_fence
```

Process the markdown file as lines:
1. When in `reading` state:
   - If line matches `` ```ltac `` (3+ backticks + "ltac"):
     record fence length N; save fence line; enter `in_ltac_fence` state.
   - Otherwise: emit line as-is.
2. When in `in_ltac_fence` state:
   - If line is exactly N backticks: record fence end; save fence-end line;
     enter `after_ltac` state; render mermaid from collected LTAC lines.
   - Otherwise: accumulate LTAC content lines.
3. When in `after_ltac` state:
   - Emit the saved LTAC fence lines (start + content + end).
   - Skip any blank lines between LTAC block and the following mermaid block
     (emit them back but remember count).
   - If next line matches `` ```mermaid `` (3+ backticks + "mermaid"):
     enter `in_mermaid_fence` state (about to replace existing mermaid).
   - Else if non-blank, non-mermaid line: insert new mermaid block before it,
     then emit the line; return to `reading` state.
4. When in `in_mermaid_fence` state:
   - Consume lines until closing fence (same N backticks).
   - Discard the old mermaid content.
   - Emit the newly generated mermaid block instead.
   - Return to `reading` state.

### In-place file rewriting

If `--inline` and filenames are given:
- Read file to string.
- Run inline processor.
- If output differs, write back to same path (overwrite).
- If no filenames given, process stdin → stdout.

Not shown: We also need to generate `click` lines.

### Explanation of key mapping decisions

- `^C3` in LTAC → asCited double-bracket `[[...]]` shape in mermaid.
- `A1` (Assumption) → Claim with `ASSUMED` suffix.
- `Ctx1` (Context child of AR1) → ArtifactReference cylinder shape,
  `--o` context arrow pointing to AR1.
- `E1` (Evidence, sole child of C2) → unreified form allowed but
  the example in docs uses a Dot1 (either is acceptable).
- `C2`, `C3`, `AR1`, and `A1` are all in the C1 inference path,
  sharing one sacmDot `Dot2 --> C1`.

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Single file** `script/ltac2mermaid`, Python 3.8+ (uses dataclasses,
   walrus operator avoided for 3.8 compat). Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.

2. **Read all before render**: parser builds full AST first; renderer then
   traverses. Required because Link nodes reference earlier-defined nodes.

3. **Node registry**: `dict[str, Node]` populated during parse; consulted for
   Link resolution. Warn on unresolved Link, duplicate identifier.

4. **Auto-identifiers**: if a node has no identifier, generate `_auto{N}`.
   Not displayed in the label (label omits the bold ID prefix).

5. **Multiple roots**: all top-level Claims render in a single flowchart.
   The BottomPadding node uses `~~~ FIRST_ROOT_ID`.

6. **Error handling**: parse errors and warnings go to stderr; processing
   continues where possible (skip malformed lines with a warning).

7. **Connector nodes**: appear in mermaid as `:::connector` open circles.
   Their children connect to them via `---`, and the Connector connects
   into the parent's inference group.

8. **Relation nodes**: no mermaid node of their own; they annotate the
   relationship between grandparent and their children with options.

9. **Hair space in sacmDot**: the dot text is a hair space (U+200A),
   consistent with the convention in `docs/sacm-mermaid.md`. Use the
   literal character in the string, or `\u200a`.

10. **ext_ref**: the external reference text `(scan.html)` is available on
    Evidence/Context nodes but is not rendered into the mermaid label by
    default (it would clutter the diagram). It may be used to generate
    hyperlinks in a future enhancement, or via an option.

## Reusable Pure Functions Summary

```python
to_github_fragment(text: str) -> str
make_mermaid_id(identifier: str, counter: list) -> str
escape_html(text: str) -> str
parse_options(raw: str) -> set

# Parser
parse_ltac_lines(lines: list[str]) -> tuple[list[Node], dict[str, Node]]
    # Returns (roots, registry)

# Renderers
render_sacm(roots: list[Node]) -> str      # -> mermaid string (with fences)
render_gsn(roots: list[Node]) -> str       # -> mermaid string (with fences)

# Inline processor
process_inline_text(text: str, render_fn) -> str
    # render_fn: list[Node] -> str

# Top-level orchestration
process_stream(stream, render_fn) -> str
process_inline_file(path: str, render_fn) -> None
```

## Open Questions / Future Extensions

- Should `ext_ref` be rendered as a hyperlink in the mermaid node?
  (Currently omitted to keep labels concise.)
- Should `click` hyperlinks be auto-generated from identifiers?
  (Needs a base URL argument; not in initial scope.)

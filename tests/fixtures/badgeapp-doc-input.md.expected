## Context Details

Additional context and evidence packages supporting the argument.

### Claim Top: The system is adequately secure against moderate threats

This is the top-level claim for the entire assurance case.

### Claim SecReqs: Security requirements are identified and met

The security requirements are documented and verified against the implementation.

### Claim SecDesign: The security design is documented and reviewed

The system design incorporates security from the ground up.

### Evidence ReqSpec: Requirements specification

See the full requirements document for details.

### Evidence TestCoverage: Test coverage report

All security tests pass with full coverage of requirements.

### Evidence DesignDoc: Security architecture document

The architecture has been reviewed by the security team.

### Evidence ThreatModel: Threat model

Threats are systematically identified and mitigated.

### Context ReqScope: Applies to all user-facing features

Defines the scope of the requirements coverage.
